# Member Onboarding

Four-step SSR onboarding wizard for incomplete USERs, gate/skip behavior for other roles, and automated browser coverage.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Automated browser coverage for onboarding wizard

Each Gherkin scenario in `docs/migration/features/onboarding.feature` SHALL have a Playwright test in `e2e/specs/onboarding.spec.ts` tracing the four-step SSR wizard (`age`, `interests`, `location`, `timing`). Tests that mutate onboarding state SHALL use a fresh USER (prefer new signup) for isolation.

#### Scenario: Onboarding gate and completion are E2E-verified

- **WHEN** a fresh USER signs up and `e2e/specs/onboarding.spec.ts` runs
- **THEN** incomplete users are redirected into the wizard, each step accepts input, and completion sets onboarding complete and routes to the membership/checkout destination implemented by the app
- **AND** ADMIN/PARTNER and already-onboarded USERs skip the wizard per the feature file

#### Scenario: Onboarding fixture helpers exist

- **WHEN** onboarding specs need to drive multi-step forms
- **THEN** helpers live in `e2e/fixtures/onboarding.ts` (or extended auth fixtures) and use proximity selectors only
