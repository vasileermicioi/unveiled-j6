## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Automated browser coverage for admin catalog management

Each Gherkin scenario in `docs/migration/features/admin-events.feature` and `docs/migration/features/admin-partners.feature` SHALL have a Playwright test with a title matching the scenario line (or Scenario Outline plus example row). Partner scenarios SHALL live in `e2e/specs/admin-partners.spec.ts` and event scenarios in `e2e/specs/admin-events.spec.ts`. Tests SHALL sign in as ADMIN via `loginAsAdmin` / `E2E_ADMIN_*`, use proximity selectors only, and use unique timestamp suffixes for created partner/event names and portal emails. Image upload/URL processing tests SHALL call `test.skip` with reason `R2 vars not configured` when any required R2 env var (`S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_REGION`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `IMAGE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`) is missing.

#### Scenario: Admin partner CRUD is E2E-verified

- **WHEN** an ADMIN runs `e2e/specs/admin-partners.spec.ts`
- **THEN** partner create/edit/delete, logo upload or URL, name propagation, QR regeneration, and portal-access flows are asserted in the browser

#### Scenario: Admin event CRUD is E2E-verified

- **WHEN** an ADMIN runs `e2e/specs/admin-events.spec.ts`
- **THEN** single and series event creation, image required/upload/URL, redemption validation, capacity recalculation, edit, delete, optional metadata, export (or explicit skip with reason), and seed-demo behaviors are asserted

#### Scenario: Published events surface on public pages

- **WHEN** an admin creates or edits an event via the E2E flow
- **THEN** the event appears on `/discover` and is viewable on `/events/:id` without authentication
- **AND** after a partner rename, the updated partner name is visible on discover for that partner's events

#### Scenario: Image tests skip when R2 is unavailable

- **WHEN** R2 / image env vars are not fully configured
- **THEN** image upload and remote-URL processing tests skip with an explicit reason string
- **AND** they do not fail the suite
