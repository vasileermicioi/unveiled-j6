# Sitemap (MVP)

Legend: **Auth** = sign-in required. **Role** = required role beyond being signed in. All app routes are under `/:locale` (`de` | `en`) unless noted.

Locale is a **route segment**. Switching language re-navigates to the same path under the other locale (e.g. `/de/events/abc` ↔ `/en/events/abc`).

**Charter locks:** Guest marketing home = locale home; Discover at `/discover`; `/events/:id` is **public**; member feed `/events` is gated; partner portal is **post-MVP** (appendix only).

## Localization & crawlers

| Route | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | — | 302 → `/de` or `/en` by `Accept-Language` (fallback `de`) |
| `/robots.txt` | — | Static allow/disallow rules — see `extras/seo-and-metadata.md` |
| `/sitemap.xml` | — | Dynamic: marketing/legal locales + bookable public event detail URLs |

---

## Guest home, Discover & public marketing

**Guest marketing home is locale home.** `/:locale` renders the membership conversion landing (headline, phone mockup, plan card, benefits). **Discover** is `/:locale/discover` (admin-curated **featured events** + admin-curated **featured partners** Partner venues marquee — not an automatic catalog slice). Bare `/discover` **302** redirects to `/:locale/discover` via `Accept-Language`.

### Guest journey (Home → Discover → Events)

1. Guest lands on marketing home (`/:locale`) — CTA to `/signup`.
2. Navbar/footer **Discover** opens `/:locale/discover`.
3. Featured **EventCard** CTAs link to public `/events/:id` (“Book Now” / “Bin dabei”, or “Waitlist” / “Warteliste” when sold out).
4. Path to the **full browse** experience: signup/login, complete onboarding, then an **active** (booking-eligible) subscription → member `/events`. Non-active members stay on Discover.
5. Guests do **not** get a public full upcoming-events list equivalent to `/events`.

| Route | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/:locale` | — | **Guest home** — membership marketing + signup CTA. Signed-in booking-eligible `USER` → `/events` (or onboarding); non-active `USER` → `/discover`; `ADMIN` → `/admin` |
| `/discover` | — | **302** → `/:locale/discover` |
| `/:locale/discover` | — | **Discover** — admin-featured events (including past featured) + Partner venues from admin-curated `featured_partners` (up to 8 by `sort_order`; section hidden when empty). Guests + non-booking-eligible `USER` OK; booking-eligible `USER` → **302** `/events`; `ADMIN` keeps access (QA) |
| `/how-it-works` | — | Static explainer |
| `/faq` | — | FAQ accordion |
| `/membership` | — | Plan details; Stripe checkout when signed in (Phase 6+) |
| `/impressum` | — | Imprint |
| `/privacy` | — | Privacy / Datenschutz |
| `/terms` | — | Terms / AGB |

## Public event detail

| Route | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/events/:id` | — | **Public** event detail (SSR). Indexable when bookable (future `date_time` + remaining capacity > 0). Sold-out/past: 200 + `noindex, follow`. Booking/waitlist/save actions require auth on dedicated routes. |

---

## Auth

| Route | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/login` | — | `@better-auth-ui/heroui`; email/password + Google |
| `/signup` | — | Registration → `USER`, onboarding incomplete |
| `/forgot-password` | — | Reset request |
| `/reset-password` | — | Token-based reset (`noindex`) |
| `/auth/callback/google` | — | Neon Auth OAuth callback |

---

## Onboarding

| Route | Auth | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/onboarding/age` | ✅ | USER, incomplete | Step 1 (skippable) |

| `/onboarding/location` | ✅ | USER, incomplete | Step 3 |

---

## Member app

| Route | Auth | Role | Notes |

| `/events/map?category=&partnerId=&from=&to=&page=` | ✅ | USER, booking-eligible | Map view — same filters + pagination as list; same audience gate as `/events` |

| `/profile/delete-account` | ✅ | USER | GDPR deletion tab |

### Guest vs member nav (summary)

| Audience | Primary nav (header) | Events path |
|---|---|---|
| **Guest** | Discover → `/discover`, FAQ; Log in (Sign up via auth routes; How it works / Membership via direct URL / in-flow CTAs) | Featured preview → `/events/:id`; full feed via signup/login + active sub → `/events` |
| **Member (`USER`) non-active** | Discover → `/discover`, FAQ; Saved + Bookings; credits badge; profile; logout | Discover featured list; `/events` / map redirect to Discover; public detail |
| **Member (`USER`) booking-eligible** | **Browse events** → `/events`, FAQ; Saved + Bookings; credits badge; profile; logout | `/events`, `/events/map`, `/saved`, public detail |
| **Admin** | Discover + FAQ where shared; admin chrome → `/admin` | Catalog via `/admin/events`; **Featured events** at `/admin/featured`; **Featured partners** at `/admin/featured-partners` |

## Error pages

| Condition | Notes |
|---|---|
| 404 | Locale-aware not-found; `noindex`; same template for bad route vs missing `:id` |
| 500 | Generic error (+ Sentry when configured) |
| 403 | Wrong role — prefer redirect/404 over leaking existence |

---

## Conventions

- **SSR-only mutations** — every create/update/delete is a dedicated page with form POST. No client-only mutation modals.
- **Query-param filters** on `/events` stay bookmarkable and SSR-friendly.
- **Cookie consent** is a layout overlay, not a route.
- Indexability: `extras/seo-and-metadata.md`. Authorization: `extras/authorization-matrix.md`.
